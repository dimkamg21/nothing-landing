## Nothing Page Landing

## Description.

This is a user-friendly landing page created using HTML, SCSS, and BEM methodology. This project is an example of how code can be organized and structured using BEM, which makes it easy to maintain and extend. 

## Structure

The project consists of the following files and folders:

- `index.html` - the main HTML page.
- `styles/` - folder with SCSS files.
  - `main.scss` - the main SCSS file that imports all other SCSS files.
  - `_variables.scss` - file with global variables.
  - `_mixins.scss` - file with SCSS mixins.
  - `blocks/` - folder with SCSS files for each component.

## Launching

To run the project on a local server, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm if you don't already have them.
2. Install Gulp globally, if you haven't already, using the command `npm install -g gulp`.
3. Install the project dependencies using the command `npm install`.
4. Run `npm install` to see project.

## BEM

BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a class naming methodology in CSS that allows you to create complex and clear structures. Each entity in BEM is labeled as a block, element, or modifier.

- A block is an independent entity that makes sense on its own, such as a button, menu, form, etc.
- An element is a part of a block that makes no sense without it, such as a list item, form item, etc.
- A modifier is a variation of a block or element, such as changing the color, size, state, etc.

## SCSS

SCSS is a CSS preprocessor that allows you to write styles more clearly and conveniently using variables, functions, mixins, etc.
